# Bloom's canon

A CSV of the list from Harold Bloom's The Western Canon, parsed from Robert Teeter's HTML:

**NB** - I don't endorse the intellectual politics of this list! (Or Bloom's personal politics, worldview, or behavior.) But it is useful as a signal of what was considered canonical by the establishment academy circa 1990.
